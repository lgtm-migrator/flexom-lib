# Flexom lib

This library allows developers to interfact with Flexom smart home APIs.

## Status

Flexom (actually Ubiant and Hemis) APIs are undocumented, so this project is built through reverse-engineering of Flexom mobile application.

Currently, the following features are implemented :

- login
- list zones
- get zone settings
- set zone setting
- list things
